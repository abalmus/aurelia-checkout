# aurelia-checkout-starter

Aurelia checkout starter for [Front end frameworks](https://milestone.tacitknowledge.com/display/FE/Front+end+frameworks) WiKi page.

> Note this is just an example, but could be used as starter for the future projects.

## Running The App

To run the app, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  jspm install -y
  ```
3. To run the app, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  gulp watch
  ```
4. Browse to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to see the app. You can make changes in the code found under `src` and the browser should auto-refresh itself as you save files.

> This App uses [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for automated page refreshes on code/markup changes concurrently across multiple browsers. If you prefer to disable the mirroring feature set the [ghostMode option](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/#option-ghostMode) to false
